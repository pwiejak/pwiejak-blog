description: "Welcome to my blog! This is my first post this year and, well... ever. My name is PaweÅ‚ (Paul), I will write probably mostly about programming and everything related to it, but who knows, maybe there will be other topics as well. Enjoy!"

Hi!

My name is Paul, software developer by day (mostly .net fullstack development). For the rest of the time - sport enthusiast (I play a lot of squash and football lately), fantasy fan (books, games, movies), husband and father, comfortable traveler.

Year 2022 seems like a year of many changes for me.
One of them is to start blogging about things that I'm trying to learn and master. For future me and future you.

I hope it will help someone to better understand some topics or just remind future me ***why the hell did I do something this way***.

> The blog is created using this starter: [Gatsby starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).
> It's very intuitive and useful, it takes less than 5 minutes from nothing to deployed starter blog.
> Since it's using react you can easily extend it anyway you want, assuming you are familiar with react of course.
> And if not, it might be a way to start.
