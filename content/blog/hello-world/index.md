Year 2022 seems like a year of changes for me.
One of them is to start blogging about things that I'm trying to learn and master. For future me and future you.

I hope it will help someone to better understand some topics or just remind future me ***why the hell did I do something this way***.

> The blog is created using this starter: [Gatsby starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).
> It's very intuitive and useful, it takes less than 5 minutes from nothing to deployed starter blog.
> Since it's using react you can easily extend it anyway you want, assuming you are familiar with react of course.
> And if not, it might be a way to start.
